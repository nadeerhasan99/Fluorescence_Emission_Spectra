This experiment explores the performance of fluorescence spectroscopy instrumentation and
the analysis of fluorescence emission spectra, focusing on the characterization of Donaldson
matrices. Using a fluorescence spectrometer, measurements were conducted to examine
the fluorescence impact of five distinct samples dyed with different fluorophores, aimed at
identifying the type of coating paint used on each sample.
